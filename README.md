# WatchingEyes

**Name:** Watching Eyes

**Description:** This is a mouse event animation that displays a pair of eyeballs continuously following your mouse movement across the screen.

**How To Run:** Download all files into the same directory and open the index.html file in a browser to view.

**Future Improvements:** Add functionality for eyes to shrink and follow your mouse around the screen after a certain timeframe.  Before that timeframe is reached, have eyes grow bigger as you move closer to them and smaller as you move away.  

**Usage:** Educational/entertainment purposes.  

**License Information:** The starter code was provided by MIT XPro Program - Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN.
